## Installation

This custom extension can be installed from the [Extensions Gallery](https://manage.auth0.com/#/extensions).

[![Auth0 Extensions](http://cdn.auth0.com/extensions/assets/badge.svg)](https://sandbox.it.auth0.com/api/run/auth0-extensions/extensions-badge?webtask_no_cache=1)

### Assets

Because this is not an official extension, the assets are not hosted in the Auth0 CDN but on GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Go to the `logs` section of your [DataDog](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs) account and filter by `source: auth0`.

## Build

In order to build the extension locally you have to have NodeJS 6+ installed and run:

To install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install --ignore-engines
```

To bundle the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Webtask

If you haven't configured Webtask on your machine run this first:

```bash
npm install -g wt-cli
wt init
```

### Deploy to Webtask.io

To run it on a schedule (run every 5 minutes for example):

```bash
yarn install && yarn build
wt cron create \
    --name auth0-logs-to-datadog \
    --secret AUTH0_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_ID" \
    --secret AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_AUTH0_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SECRET" \
    --secret DATADOG_API_KEY="YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY" \
    --schedule "*/5 * * * *" \
    build/bundle.js
```

The following settings are optional:

 - `LOG_LEVEL`: This allows you to specify the log level of events that need to be sent.
 - `LOG_TYPES`: If you only want to send events with a specific type (eg: failed logins). This needs to be a comma separated list.

> You can get your Global Client Id/Secret here: https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2

## Filters

The `DATADOG_SERVER` can be set to:

- `US` (default): which will send data to Datadog US servers: intake.logs.datadoghq.com:10516
- `EU`: which will send data to Datadog EU servers: tcp-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu:443

The `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to (setting it to a value will also send logs of a higher value):

 - `1`: Debug messages
 - `2`: Info messages
 - `3`: Errors
 - `4`: Critical errors

The `LOG_TYPES` filter can be set to:

- `s`: Success Login (level: 1)
